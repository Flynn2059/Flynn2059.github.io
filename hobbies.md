# Hobbies

Over the years, I've developed a few hobbies that bring me joy, relaxation, and opportunities to connect with like-minded people. These include powerlifting, coffee brewing, and tinkering with various tech projects.

## Powerlifting 💪
Powerlifting has become a core part of my life. I started training because I was completely inactive during high school and wanted to change my body and overcome the associated body shame. Throughout my undergraduate and master's studies in clinical medicine, powerlifting has been my way to unwind from academic pressure. <br>

Moreover, it has allowed me to meet diverse individuals, both in the gym and at competitions, enriching my social life and mental well-being.<br>

## Tech Projects 💻
I enjoy experimenting with technology and setting up various systems for both practical use and personal curiosity. My motivation stems from the belief that *if someone else can build something great, I should be able to as well*. These projects have also given me a solid foundation for **bioinformatics analysis**, helping me navigate coding errors with greater confidence.

- **HomeAssistant** for smart home automation
